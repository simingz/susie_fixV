\usage{
single_effect_regression_rss(z, Sigma, V = 1, prior_weights = NULL,
  optimize_V = c("none", "optim", "uniroot", "EM", "simple"),
  check_null_threshold = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A p vector.}

\item{Sigma}{\code{residual_var*R + lambda*I}}

\item{V}{The prior variance.}

\item{prior_weights}{A p vector of prior weights.}

\item{optimize_V}{Boolean indicating whether to optimize V (by
maximum likelihood).}

\item{check_null_threshold}{A scalar threshold on the log-scale to
compare likelihood between current estimate and zero (the null).}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:

\item{alpha}{Vector of posterior inclusion probabilities. i.e.,
  \code{alpha[i]} is posterior probability that that the ith
  coefficient is non-zero.}

\item{mu}{Vector of posterior means (conditional on inclusion).}

\item{mu2}{Vector of posterior second moments (conditional on
  inclusion).}

\item{lbf}{Vector of log-Bayes factors for each variable.}

\item{V}{The prior variance (after optimization if \code{optimize_V
  != "none"}).}

\item{lbf_model}{The log-likelihood for the total model minus the
  log-likelihood for the null model.}
}
\description{
Performs single-effect linear regression with z
  scores. That is, this function fits the regression model \eqn{z =
  Rb + e}, where e is \eqn{N(0,Sigma)}, \eqn{Sigma = residual_var*R +
  lambda*I}, and the b is a p-vector of effects to be estimated. The
  assumption is that b has exactly one non-zero element, with all
  elements equally likely to be non-zero. The prior on the non-zero
  element is \eqn{N(0,V)}.
}
\details{
The summary data required are the p by p correlation
  matrix R, the p vector z. The summary stats should come from the
  same individuals.
