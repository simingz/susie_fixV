\title{Extract credible sets from SuSiE fit}
\usage{
susie_get_cs(res, X = NULL, Xcorr = NULL, coverage = 0.95,
  min_abs_corr = 0.5, dedup = TRUE, squared = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{a susie fit, the output of `susieR::susie()`, or simply the posterior
inclusion probability matrix alpha.}

\item{X}{N by P matrix of values of the P variables (covariates) in N samples.
When provided, correlation between variables will be computed and used to remove
CSs whose minimum correlation among variables is smaller than `min_abs_corr` (see below).}

\item{Xcorr}{P by P matrix of correlations between variables (covariates).
When provided, it will be used to remove CSs
whose minimum correlation among variables is smaller than `min_abs_corr` (see below).}

\item{coverage}{a number (in [0,1]) specifying desired coverage of each CS}

\item{min_abs_corr}{a "purity" threshold for the CS. Any CS that contains
a pair of variables with correlation less than this threshold will be filtered out and not reported.}

\item{dedup}{If TRUE, "deduplicate" - that is remove duplicated CSs.}

\item{squared}{If TRUE, report min, mean and median of squared correlation instead of absolute correlation.}
}
\value{
a list with elements:

\item{cs}{a list, each element corresponds to a CS, and is a vector containing the indices of the variables in the CS.}
\item{coverage}{the nominal coverage specified for each CS.}
\item{purity}{(If `X` or `Xcorr` are provided), the purity of each CS.}
\item{cs_index}{(If `X` or `Xcorr` are provided) the index (in 1,...,L) of each reported CS in the supplied susie fit.}
}
\description{
Extract credible sets from SuSiE fit
}
\details{
Reports indices of variables in each credible set (CS) identified,
as well as summaries of correlation among the variables included in each CS.Revised from susieR::susie_get_cs.
If desired, one can filter out CSs that do not meet a specified purity threshold (min_abs_corr);
to do this either `X` or `Xcorr` must be supplied.
